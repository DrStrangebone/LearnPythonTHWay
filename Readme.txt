DrStrangebone's progress:

I have done a lot since I first started June 26th. 

During that time, I had a very steady progression. I'm about to hit my ex20.py.

This means I'm going to review back the files and make sure I understand them before going further.

Hopefully by ex40.py the previous lessons will click and I'll be able to understand, who knows?

Happy Coding! :D
