DrStrangebone's progress:

I have done a lot since I first started June 26th (today is July 2nd).

During that time, I had a very steady progression. I'm about to hit my ex20.py.

This means I'm going to review back the files and make sure I understand them before going further.

Hopefully by ex40.py the previous lessons will click and I'll be able to understand, who knows?

Happy Coding! :D

DrStrangebone's progress - July 5th 2015

I've only slacked for nearly 2 days. I should feel bad. AC/DC's making me feel better though.

Anyway, in this update I am currently refreshing on what I know and solidify what I've learnt.
It'll happen in bigtest.py file. Feel free to point out what I could improve!

Happy coding! :D
