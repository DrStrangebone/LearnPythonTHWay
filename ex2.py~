print "Roosters", 100 - 25 * 3 % 4
#Need to understand the modulus
# '*' and '%' take precedence over '-'. So, 25 * 3 % 4.
# '*' and '%' have the same priority and associativity from left to right, so we evaluate left to right. 
#Starting with 25 * 3 = 75. 75 % 4 = 3. Finally, 100 - 3 = 97.

print "Modulus: ", 75 % 4
#75 % 4 = 3. 75 / 4 = 18, so 4 * 18 = 72, left over is 3 thus total 75.
